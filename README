cdp is a small program to cd into one of the parent/grand-parent/... of the current directory instead of cd ../../../../target

It should be used when you are deep inside a directory hierarchy and want to go to one of the intermediate directory

Install: Place the script in somewhere you like, and source the script in the .bashrc or .bash_profile

Usage: cdp [DIRECTORY]

if DIRECTORY is empty, it will by default go to the parent directory
